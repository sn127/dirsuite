# Utils

 * utils-fs
   - java.nio.{Files,Paths} path manipulating utilities
   - Recursive findFiles with glob and regex pattern
 * utils-testing
   - Scalatest-like `DirSuite` to run collection of tests with
     predefined input and output references on filesystem.


## Documentation

 * [docs/dirsuite.md](./docs/dirsuite.md) has some general information about dirsuite
 * [docs/howto.md](./docs/howto.md) has examples against dirsuite's own tests

## Contributing to Utils

Contributions to the project are most welcome. Please see 
[CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) how you could help. 

Your pull requests can be merged only if you can certify 
the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), Version 1.1](./DCO). 
To certify DCO (e.g. sign-off your commit), you must add 
a `Signed-off-by` line to **every**  git commit message 
(e.g. `git commit -s`):

    Signed-off-by: github-account <your.real@email.address>

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` in git configs,
then git will include that line for you with `git commit -s`. 
These settings can be done per repository basis, 
so they don't have be global settings in your system. 
 
Please make sure that you sign-off all your PR's commits. 


## Thanks

See [THANKS](./THANKS.md) for full list of credits. Most notably 
this started as a test tool for [Abandon](https://github.com/hrj/abandon) 
and it grew from there to be something generally useful. 

Obviously without [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) this project 
would not exists.
